                    As technology continues to develop and society turns to screens, it is very
                    important to realize the value in time spent outdoors. Colleges now offer online
                    options and many people now have remote jobs from home. The world is turning more online,
                    while the outdoors are waiting.

                    I wasn’t always as online as I am now, I grew up in Door County, the beautiful peninsula in
                    northern Wisconsin that provides many opportunities for outdoor exploration and relaxation.
                    My family was very fortunate to live a mere 10 minute walk away from a beautiful beach. I recall
                    the hot summer days where I would sprint to that beach after work to swim and lie in the sun for
                    hours, just to return home and wake up and do it again the next day. I loved the cool autumn nights
                    my mom and I would spend walking around our town, now quiet and alone from tourists. Or when I would
                    disappear for hours to a beach only a few locals knew about at the very tip of the peninsula. Living in
                    Door County fueled my love for the outdoors and the beach. It didn’t have to be some intense hike
                    or exploration, I was just basking in the natural beauty I was surrounded in. Being at the beaches
                    calmed me down, and I’d spend hours there listening to the waves crash or finding mysterious shells
                    and trinkets hidden in the sand. It was, and is, my happy place.

                    When COVID hit in 2020 during my sophomore year of high school, my world flipped upside down.
                    My parents owned a small business, and all of my classes went online. My rural high school did its
                    best to deliver adequate online schooling, but I was eager to leave and try something new. I
                    switched to a fully online high school for the remainder of my high school years. I even attended
                    my high school graduation online. At the time I didn’t see anything wrong with these decisions,
                    as it was an unprecedented time for me, my family and the whole world. It also gave me a chance to
                    help my family with the business, which is an experience I will hold onto for the rest of my life.
                    I dove headfirst into the world of computers, enlisting the help of friends I’d found online in building
                    my first computer that I still use to this day. After working at my parents' hotel I would come home and
                    play video games for hours until the very early morning.

                    I moved to Madison by myself for college in 2022 and it was a big change. After my first semester at
                    MATC I switched to the Web Development program and started taking many online coding classes. I was on
                    my computer 24/7. The dreams of swimming in Eagle Harbor and Europe Bay fizzled out, and I was looking
                    forward to the days where I could just immerse myself into the world of video games, after I had already
                    been on my computer for hours. It was becoming clear to me that I was changing fundamentally. Instead of
                    spending my summers working and relaxing in Door County, I was holed up in my apartment years after COVID
                    protocols were finished. I was angry and jealous of my friends who got to stay in Door County while I was
                    away for school, even though I knew school was something important that I needed to be focused on.

                    So when my boyfriend asked me to go on a camping trip to Devils Lake last summer, I knew deep down I needed it.
                    My memories of laying on the sand came flooding back to me and I realized that I had been missing the outdoors for
                    so long. I had so many pent up emotions. We spent two days hiking, exploring and swimming at Devils Lake State Park.
                    Maybe it was the fact that I was spending time doing what I love with a person I loved but it made it so meaningful
                    for me. With no worries of school or work, I was able to fully relax, just how I had during those Door County summers.

                    After the trip we returned to Madison and started back in our old online routines again. But this time
                    it was different. Instead of shutting out my memories of Door County, I fantasized about them. I yearned
                    for the beaches and the quietness of it all. I knew I needed to go back and experience it all again. Maybe
                    one day I will live in Door County again and bask in its beauty. Moving forward I want to continue to seek
                    out nature, by camping or by just walking outside. Madison is a beautiful city and I don’t want to take my
                    time here for granted. Technology has been made in a way that is so easy to fall back on, but the moments
                    without it are the most meaningful to me. Do you have a special place that you hold fond memories for?
