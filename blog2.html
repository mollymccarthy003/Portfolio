                        Linocut printing is the art of carving a design into a block,
                        rolling on ink and pressing it onto a surface to reveal a bold
                        handmade print. It is extremely affordable to try out and offers
                        artists endless opportunities to create. I have been creating prints,
                        patches and tote bags from my linocut designs for about 3 years now and
                        I’ve loved every minute of the process. Last summer I was able to sell
                        my art to the local Madison community and it was a blast. Linocut printing
                        is a timeless, accessible art form that combines craftsmanship, technique
                        and creativity to produce striking handmade designs.

                        Developed in the 20th century, linocut was made as an easier alternative to woodcut.
                        Woodcut is essentially the same thing as linocut, but using wood as the block.
                        Woodcut is significantly harder than linocut due to the hardness and grain of the
                        wood compared to the soft linoleum. Linoleum is more commonly used in flooring,
                        but in the 1890s, artists started to use it as a medium in printing. One very famous
                        piece of linocut was done by Pablo Picasso in 1958 titled “Portrait of a Woman after
                        Cranach the Younger.” It features a bold multicolored design. Today it is popular
                        among beginner printmakers and longtime professionals (Rich Fowler, 2025).

                        The linocut process is long but rewarding. Start by creating a design and sketching
                        it onto the linoleum block. Remember that when printed, the design will appear backwards
                        or flipped, so remember to flip your design, especially if there are letters involved.
                        Next, slowly carve out negative space from your design using various carving tools. Take
                        your time and try to be as accurate as possible for a clean look. Once you are happy with
                        your design it is time to roll ink onto it. Using a roller or brayer, apply an even coat
                        onto your linoleum block and make sure to use the correct type of ink for your printing
                        surface. Finally, press your design onto paper or fabric to reveal your handmade linocut
                        print! There will be some variation to each print you make which makes the art even more
                        fluid and fun. Linocut has a very satisfying tactile process!

                        Linocut printing requires many tools in order to start creating, but thankfully you can
                        find cheaper kits with everything you need to get started inside. The essential tools are
                        a linoleum block, various sizes of carving tools, a brayer or a roller, ink for paper or
                        fabric, and paper or fabric to print on! When carving linocut blocks, make sure to point
                        your carving tool away from you to prevent any injuries (Rich Fowler, 2025). The carving
                        tools are small and sharp, so make sure to keep track of them. Linocut is a great medium
                        if you are looking to create variations of one design. Linocut designs are elevated if you
                        use a technique called color layering. It is the process of creating a print in layers, so
                        each color of the print would be a differently carved linocut block. For making a tomato,
                        you’d have the stem that you’d ink in green and the tomatoes that would be red. You can even
                        get variation through using your hands to press your linocut down versus using a press. Using
                        different materials to print on allows for great creative freedom.

                        Artists and hobbyists both love linocut for the same reasons: simplicity, affordability,
                        bold aesthetic and variations. Many small artists sell prints online or at art markets,
                        or post process videos on social media. If you haven’t tried linocut printing before I
                        highly suggest it! It is a great way to experience the joy of making art with your hands.
                        Linocut proves that even the simplest of tools can create powerful artistic expression.

                        Have you tried an art medium similar to linocut before? What were some of the struggles you
                        faced while learning the medium? Start a conversation with you friends and attend a class! The picture
