                        Colleges should require students to complete an internship before graduation because
                        internships give students real-world experience, help them build professionalism, and
                        allow them to discover what they actually want to do. My internship at the Morgridge
                        Institute for Research showed me firsthand how much more prepared, capable, and motivated
                        a student becomes once they’ve stepped outside the classroom and into real work, especially
                        IT focused careers. If colleges truly want students to graduate ready for their careers, internships should be essential.

                        Students should be required to complete internships because they are the most effective
                        bridge between academic learning and real-world careers. No matter how strong an educational
                        program is, lectures and homework can only take students so far. An internship forces students
                        to apply what they’ve learned in an environment where the consequences are real and the standards
                        are higher. It’s this jump from controlled classroom exercises to authentic work that gives
                        students the preparation they need. Think high school to college, it's just another level up in
                        your education and career journey!

                    <p>
                        The first reason colleges should require internships is that they provide hands-on skills that the
                        classroom simply can’t replicate. During my internship, I got to learn about the technology I was using,
                        while I was using it.  I got to work with different JavaScript frameworks like Liquid and NodeJS to update
                        various websites. These tools weren’t hypothetical or used for class projects, I was working on websites
                        that actual people navigate through daily, nationwide. Learning how to navigate these new coding languages,
                        troubleshoot issues, and follow actual research workflows gave me technical knowledge I could never have
                        gained in a traditional class. Internships let students move beyond theory into application, and that
                        experience makes them far more capable when they graduate.

                    <p>
                        Second, internships help students develop professional confidence and maturity. Many graduates struggle
                        with the transition from college assignments to workplace expectations. During my internship, I learned
                        how to work with supervisors, communicate updates clearly, ask better questions, and adjust my work when things
                        didn’t go as planned. I learned what it feels like to be part of a team and how to stay organized in a fast-moving
                        environment. These skills are foundational to success in any career. They are also very difficult to teach in a
                        classroom setting. An internship forces students to practice these habits in a real setting, and that experience
                        builds confidence that carries into every future job.

                    <p>
                        Finally, internships help students figure out what they actually want from their careers. Many students
                        graduate unsure of their direction simply because they’ve never tried working in a real environment. My
                        internship helped me realize that I enjoy technical, research-focused work and want to continue building
                        those skills, while creating artful websites. Other students might discover they want something completely
                        different, only because they got to experience their internship. Requiring internships ensures that every
                        student has the chance to explore, test their interests, and make informed decisions before graduating. In an
                        increasingly expensive world, this is essential for preparing for life ahead of college.

                        Colleges should require internships because they prepare students for the world they’re about to enter.
                        My experience at the Morgridge Institute for Research showed me how transformative an internship can be,
                        both personally and professionally. If colleges truly want to equip students for success, making internships
                        mandatory is the smartest step forward.
