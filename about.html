    <h1>Molly McCarthy | Graphic Design Student</h1>
    <p>I am super excited to announce that I will be attending UW-Madison for Graphic Design in Spring of 2026.
        I graduated from Madison Area Technical College with two Assosciate Degrees, IT-Web Software Development
        and Liberal Arts. Thank you for checking out my writing. This site was made for my social media writing class
        at MATC in Fall 2025.</p>
    <p>Here are some photos of my linocut work over the past three years.</p>
